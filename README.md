# Structural Path Analysis

Scripts for structural path analysis in R. The original scripts were in Matlab belongs to  Glen Peters, Cicero. It is a traslation of the scripts given in Prof. Scott Matthews at al. book: Life Cycle Assessment: Quantitative Approaches for Decisions that Matter, available at lcatextbook.com

## TO DO
- Graphs diagrams on sequence of algorithm implementation
- Building the tree(build_tree.R) have some issues and needs to be sorted out. Rest works fine.
- BFS or DFS graph algoriths can be explored with regard to this scripts. Graphblas can be an excellent choice
